                    I never fully thought of myself as a nihilist until the quote “Everything happens for a reason” irked me.
                    I thought, in a world as vast as ours, why would there be an explanation to every action?
                    Until I realized when reading the sources regarding developmental theories that every single thing that
                    happens to us in our lives contributes to who you are today. In all honesty, I had a slight existential crisis.

                    <p>
                        “Is the reason I’m only 4’9 because of genetics or because I might have chromosomal problems?”
                        So I asked my mother.
                    </p>

                        She said, “No, Milourd, you’re healthy and normal.”

                    <p>
                        As I kept on reading the studies by numerous people,
                        I remembered my mother’s mother and her sisters were all mainly 4 feet tall too.
                        I sighed in relief but also got infuriated that I inherited the short gene.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This event made my resentment of the quote dissipate.
                        If my genetic makeup can explain my complex regarding my height,
                        it’s almost a given that anything and everything does have a meaning.
                        Or, more precisely, a reason.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <br>

                    <p>I still don’t believe in giving meaning to every situation,
                        because it deescalates the fact that misfortunes in life are normal;
                        and whether they were self-inflicted or not,
                        it is still a normal phase in life to have events like that.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="ent-nol" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">
                    <p>This is also true for my perception of positive happenings too,
                        as I believe that it is not the work of a higher being that resulted
                        from your hard work to accomplishments.
                        I believe in the capacity of human trial-and-error,
                        which is why my reassessment of my understanding of
                        “Everything happens for a reason” is that of acceptance
                        of the present because of the workings of the past.

                    <p>Our current circumstance is an accumulation of the past,
                        whether it is good or bad. Everything happens for a reason,
                        and the reason is for our growth. Except for my height, I guess.
