                <p>I can never remember a moment in my childhood where I was not being babied.
                   Maybe it’s because I’m the youngest of two siblings,
                   but I don’t think that counts when I have as complicated a household as the one I currently have.
                   To make this journal entry not take an hour to read; basically my parents left me and my sister to our grandmother’s care at age 4,
                   alongside numerous cousins who have identical circumstances.
                   Now imagine that but moving from numerous provinces in the
                   Philippines; Kiamba, to Marbel, to Catmon, to Balamban, then finally, Cebu.
                   And then Talisay. Perhaps it is because my grandmother’s feet itch when she’s not travelling or doing something.
                   I guess I got that trait from her. I might have mentioned how I was being babied,
                   but now that I think about it, it might have been due to my being smaller than my peers.
                   In every flag ceremony, I would always be in front.
                   I’d like to thank my mother’s mother for that; I had inherited the unlucky short gene.
                   And the unlucky nearsighted gene. And the other unlucky well-endowed gene. Basically,
                   I’m genetically a weird combination of a middle-aged woman and a child in middle school.
                   Which honestly can explain me both physically and mentally.

                    In school, my grandmother’s workaholic tendencies
                    (having to work earnestly to afford her six children’s education)
                    and my other grandmother’s passion for education (being a teacher and even hiking to indigenous peoples’
                    villages just to teach) resulted in my being an honor student.
                    Well, that’s oversimplified. My own workaholic grandmother,
                    who stays up until midnight taking care of the house,
                    scolds me for staying late in school because of projects.
                    And my other grandmother, who, though I only see once a year,
                    keeps on commenting about how I haven’t grown in height.
                    Calling the kettle black, you know?
                </p>
                </div>
                <div class="ent-nol" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">
                <p>
                    I was so defensive of myself and now that I am learning about human development,
                    it dawns on me that the Nature Vs. Nurture debate is not a black and white spectrum;
                    there is always a middle ground, the gray area. Our nature is affected by our nurture,
                    and our nurture is affected by our nature. We are raised in different circumstances and households;
                    and our personality determines our parents’ or guardians’ method of upbringing.
                    In the past, I may have been biased about nurture being the determining factor of how one develops;
                    but as I grow as a person and as a human, I realize everything is not black and white,
                    and that there are numerous other shades that I have never realized I was seeing before.

                        <p>If you ask my family and my friends whether I was mature or not,
                           you would get such varied answers. This weird combination of a middle-aged
                            woman and a child in middle school somehow feel like two different people at home and at school.
                            Which is weird to describe myself when I’m 18.</p>
                        <div class="ent-nol" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">
                        <p>
                            At school, I’m accustomed to taking the role of a leader;
                            I can’t remember a school year in my life where I wouldn’t join an organization.
                            From school magazines, to Student Supreme Governments, to Commission on Elections;
                            if I wasn’t doing more than I should, that wouldn’t be me. Which is why my peers in school,
                            before knowing me more, always thought I was intimidating; not that my poker face helped.
                            Despite being a year younger than most of them,
                            they always would think I was much older than them because of how I acted.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                        <div class="ent-nol" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">
                        <p>
                            The exact opposite happens when I’m at home, though.
                            Because of how incapable I am of most things at home (partly because most of my time is dedicated to my studies);
                            my cousins who were younger than me would end up taking care of me. I honestly still feel like a child at home,
                            having to be reminded to eat, to drink my medicine, sometimes to even come out of the house to stop studying.
                            It also doesn’t help how much more quiet I am at home;
                            I don’t share much with my family nor am I as close to my sister as she is with my family.
                            Since, well, I usually share much more of my social time with my friends.
                        </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="ent-nol" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">
                        <p>
                            These friends I refer to are people who don't know how I am at school or at home;
                            and only ever know me as being loud and energetic. Friends, who apparently,
                            got shocked that I was older than I seemed. It was to the point where a joke of me being a secret 14-year-old was formulated and constantly being brought up.
                            According to them, how I act was so deceiving because I don’t show my age at all.
                            That is, until I talked with one of them recently.
                            They were going through a hard patch in their life,
                            and in confiding with me, they opened up about how mature I was compared to them.
                            This honestly took me aback, as I always thought that my friends don’t think that at all;
                            and just how genuine that statement was, I started to fully comprehend my age;
                            and that I may just be a weird combination between a middle-aged woman and a child in middle school.
