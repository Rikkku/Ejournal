        <p>I have always been fascinated by the Nature Vs. Nurture debate.
          Despite how many studies or research I find, this back and forth notion of your genetics and your
          environment becoming the determining factor which explains your development always divides me.
          I consider myself to be a pretty biased person, and when I have a certain belief I tend not to
          open my eyes to the whole picture. Until I learned how it stunted my growth.
          It might have been due to my nature of being hardheaded;
          or it might have been due to my grandmother’s upbringing,
          but it was only until a few years ago that I realized that my beliefs do not have to be stagnant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since researching my past and present behavior and just how different it is, I started seeing patterns.
          I would always get intimidated when people try to reprimand me for my behavior;
          and automatically think that they are against me, when it is really the opposite.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was so defensive of myself and now that I am learning about human development,
          it dawns on me that the Nature Vs. Nurture debate is not a black and white spectrum;
          there is always a middle ground, the gray area. Our nature is affected by our nurture,
          and our nurture is affected by our nature. We are raised in different circumstances and households;
          and our personality determines our parents’ or guardians’ method of upbringing.
          In the past, I may have been biased about nurture being the determining factor of how one develops;
          but as I grow as a person and as a human, I realize everything is not black and white,
          and that there are numerous other shades that I have never realized I was seeing before.
