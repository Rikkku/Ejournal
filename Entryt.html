                    In every hobby I have; I never had the habit of asking other people for help.
                    When I had an interest in new hobbies I would always try to do everything myself because relying on other
                    people to help me improve repulsed me.
                    I was repulsed by myself for having to need help with anything from anyone.

                        I never could fully pinpoint the exact moment that my pride would swallow me in guilt
                        for having to ask for help from anyone. Maybe the waters of my pride slowly filled me
                        little by little over time since my childhood; but I remember one moment where the shame
                        of seeking knowledge from others flooded me.

                        Grade 7; Intramurals Day.
                        I was so interested in volleyball
                        at that time because my friends and
                        I watched the same show about the sport.
                        So, I wanted to learn how to play it properly
                        by joining the sports team during Intrams.
                        I told my mother enthusiastically about everything;
                        eager for her to know. Since both her and my father are overseas,
                        I seldom tell them what I do on a daily basis.
                        I told her how I wanted to play volleyball.

                        I think that’s when I just clammed up about myself.
                        I never told them I started to improve on my drawing skills.
                        I never told them I was trying to learn how to sing.
                        I never told them I was taking an interest in music production.
                        I just let them think I focused on academics;
                        since that’s what they know me for.
                        If they ask what I’m doing I tell a white lie and just tell them I’m doing school.

                    <p>
                        And it’s because of how many hobbies I wanted to improve on that I slowly became a workaholic.
                        I would rarely see my family or go out with them
                        ; just choosing to stay in my room, working on myself.
                        I would rarely open my mouth to talk to my family.

                        I found comfort in the solace of the island I put myself in.
                        I surrounded myself in the flood of shame I felt for trying to improve.
                        Instead of building a boat to ride the waves I made an island for myself.
                        I could never fully rely on other people since then;
                        and until now, the shame of asking for help still burns me.

                        Over the horizon, I see the boat of opportunity coming towards me.
                        After being an emotional recluse for about 2 years,
                        I impulsively moved to another school.
                        I’ve always been a loud, outgoing kid;
                        but at that moment, 4 years ago, I wasn’t myself.
                        The opportunity to change was there, and I rode it.

                    <p>
                        The journey wasn’t easy.
                        I had to fight myself to be myself again;
                        as complicated as that may be.
                        The moment I decided for myself was when I finally talked to my mother about what I wanted to do again.
                        “Can I have a piano?”

                        After a few days, she bought one,
                        hauling the thing all the way from the mall herself.
                        I felt myself turn around, knowing where to finally go.

                        I taught myself many things,
                        but I always knew that I wouldn’t improve if not for others.
                        I can learn as many things as I want;
                        but I could never fully understand what I learned had it been by myself.

                        In a way, I knew that I kept jumping between Piaget and Vygotsky’s theories;
                        I was an independent learner who always wanted to get better at everything;
                        and would try to take on more than I could handle;
                        expecting myself to know about so many things at such a young age,
                        and not knowing I needed someone else.

                        From past experiences,
                        I know I learn better with others’ help.
                        Knowing the groundwork of what others do and then applying them to what I do myself
                        has made me learn more about myself, others, and my capabilities.
                        I still feel the flood of shame in asking for help, but I know how to build a boat now.
