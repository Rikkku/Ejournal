                    I have many hobbies.
                    When I was in Grade 5 I started to enjoy reading and writing so much that I would go to our library everyday
                    and borrow one book a day.
                    As a result I got a Bookworm award when I graduated elementary.
                    I fondly remember our librarian asking if I really read all the books I borrowed;
                    and going wide-eyed when I said it only took an hour or less for me to finish 300 pages or so.
                    Around that time I started writing Jack Frost and Elsa fanfiction on Wattpad, amassing about 12,000 reads.
                    Interacting with my readers and fellow writers gave me more reason to do it more and more,
                    until about a year later my family found my Wattpad; and since then I’ve never touched that website ever since.
                </p>
                <div class="ent-nol" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">
                    <p>
                        I think, for that moment since I never fully came back to loving writing as much as I did back then.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <br>

                <div class="ent-nol" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">
                    <p>
                        In Grade 8, I joined a community that was interested in Japanese songs;
                        singing covers, making art for their videos, and animating music videos became a hobby of mine.
                        I was late to the party but I began learning how to sing; albeit secretly.
                        I only practiced in school with friends who knew of my hobby. I never told my family about it.
                        I’ve always been “okay” at drawing but since joining the community I made myself learn and improve more
                        and more so I could be at the same level as people I looked up to. Then at Grade 10,
                        I realized making music was something I liked; and I made myself learn music production; specifically, vocal mixing and mastering.
                        I befriended music producers who were in the same community; and started doing covers of my own.
                        As I did it more I know I improved; and began posting them. Until my family found out and I started doing it less.
                    </p>

                <div class="ent-nol" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">
                    <p>
                        I have trouble focusing on one hobby and never fully improve in one because of just how many I have.
                        I was always comfortable with being a jack of all trades,
                        but I never addressed why I didn’t just try to fixate myself to it.
                        And writing it down now, I realize it all stems from me not wanting to share something with my family.
                        In everything I do, I like keeping it to myself and people I trust enough to share it with;
                        and I have never shared it with my family on my own will. They have always known it from slightly unethical methods;
                        like stalking my friends, and they are confused on why I don’t share my hobbies.

                        We are like Orobus; a never-ending cycle that never stops because of our habits.
                        I don’t tell them stuff about me because they force myself into my life;
                        and they force myself into my life because I never tell them anything.
                        I understand that it is my fault for becoming a recluse within the family,
                        and only ever talk to them regarding academic
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        struggles; I don’t tell them about my struggles or my interests.
                        But I know it was because we never had the culture of discussing that when I was growing up;
                        instead only being about trivial matters such as “Kumusta na man ka?” and so.
                        I am not comfortable with my family because I do not feel comfortable with them.
                        I always walk around eggshells when I do tell them about things I want to share; fearing their judgement or worry over me.
                        I do understand their side, but I also know that it is hard for me to change the personality they had a part in shaping.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="ent-nol" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">
                    <p>
                        I am much more comfortable with listening to their day and sharing little to no commonalities with them;
                        “Busy lang sa school hahaha”. I know it may have been a generational culture that they can’t fully break out of;
                        as I know just how uptight my family from both sides are. Right now,
                        I’m still struggling on how I can share my interests with them and fully talk to them,
                        and it is a really hard struggle.
                        But I think it would be a step in the betterment of my familial bonds and myself as well.
                        If they can’t break out of their generational curses,
                        I should try to help them. And maybe, just maybe, Orobus would finally stop eating itself, you know?
